want to test:
5 finger position, flex or non flex
	- 5 outputs (fingers), 8 inputs
5 finger position, assuming 3 levels of articulation (out, half-bent, full-bent) are sufficient to determine chord structure
	- 15 outputs (3 * 5 fingers), 8 inputs
x where x is the number of intended recognized chords
	- x outputs, 8 inputs
5 finger position, 3 level, onset and offset behaviour, 8*y where y is number of previous time points desired
	- x * 5 fingers (where x is intended resolution)

need:
test data and/or a way of gathering it (method or app)
	- preferably of more than one person
	- training set with guitar and without guitar (actual air)

to consider:
strumming hand input - how to take it?
